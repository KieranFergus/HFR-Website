            The purpose of this study was to examine how people select authentication methods in a simulated online account setup. To create a realistic setting, we designed the website to resemble a genuine account creation process; however, no personal information or credentials you entered were saved beyond your authentication choice.
            <br><br>
            We apologize for the deception used. This approach was necessary to ensure that participant responses reflected natural decision-making in an authentic-feeling environment. If you have any questions about the study or would like more details on the findings, please feel free to contact us: <br><br><span class="db2"> <a href="mailto:kieran.fergus@tufts.edu">kieran.fergus@tufts.edu</a> <br> <a href="mailto:camilo.wu@tufts.edu">camilo.wu@tufts.edu</a></span>
